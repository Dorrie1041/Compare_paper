# --- Individual disqualification prompts ---

evaluation_prompt: |
  You are reviewing academic papers. Disqualify a paper **only if** it clearly lacks any form of empirical, experimental, or quantitative evaluation.

  A paper should be considered **qualified** if it provides evidence of evaluation anywhere in the document, including:
  • Sections or paragraphs labeled “Evaluation”, “Experiments”, “Results”, or similar.
  • Text discussing benchmarks, metrics, comparisons, or datasets.
  • Performance tables, figures, or graphs (even if not under a dedicated evaluation section).
  • Phrases such as:
    – “We evaluate our method on…”
    – “Our approach achieves better results than…”
    – “Figure X shows…”

  Do not disqualify a paper just because the evaluation appears later or is not clearly sectioned.

  Answer with:
  - Qualified. Reason: <brief explanation>
  - Disqualified: no evaluation. Reason: <brief explanation>

related_work_prompt: |
  You are reviewing academic papers. Disqualify a paper **only if** it does not meaningfully engage with prior research in any part of the text.

  Disqualify if:
  • The paper contains few or no academic citations.
  • It only cites tools, frameworks, or datasets without context or discussion.
  • It does not explain or compare its method to previous work.
  • It completely lacks discussion of prior research, even outside a “Related Work” section.

  If the paper includes meaningful citations or comparison to previous research anywhere (e.g., Introduction, Background, Implementation), it should be qualified.

  Answer with:
  - Qualified. Reason: <brief explanation>
  - Disqualified: no related work. Reason: <brief explanation>

novelty_prompt: |
  You are reviewing academic papers. Disqualify a paper **only if** it clearly lacks novelty—meaning it contributes no new ideas, methods, applications, or results.

  Consider a paper **qualified** if it shows novelty in any of the following ways:
  • Proposes a new method, algorithm, architecture, dataset, or insight.
  • Applies known techniques in a novel context or domain.
  • Makes clear claims of contribution, such as:
    – “We propose a new...”
    – “Our main contribution is...”
    – “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first...”
    – “Unlike previous work...”

  Do not disqualify based solely on summary tables or performance results—look for novelty claims anywhere in the text.

  Answer with:
  - Qualified. Reason: <brief explanation>
  - Disqualified: no novelty. Reason: <brief explanation>

review_only_prompt: |
  You are reviewing academic papers. Disqualify any paper **only if** it is a survey or review paper.

  Disqualify if:
  • The **title contains the word "survey" or "review"**.
  • OR the main body primarily summarizes existing work without introducing new contributions.

  Otherwise, it should be considered qualified.

  Answer in this format:
  - Disqualified: review paper. Reason: <brief explanation>
  - Qualified. Reason: <brief explanation>

verification_prompt: |
  You are a senior reviewer asked to verify if prior decisions on paper acceptance were justified.

  Below is a paper and a series of past disqualification or qualification decisions.

  Please respond whether the **final decision** appears valid or not, considering all reasoning. Be brief.

  Respond only with:
  - Correct: <short comment>
  - Incorrect: <short reason>
